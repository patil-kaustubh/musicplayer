# musicplayer
Case study of a music player using core java concepts. For this project, I used Eclipse IDE. Created project, packages, classes and interface as per requirement. Used core java concepts like Inheritance, Decision making statements, Looping statements, Scanner, Object creation, etc. Please have a look at my project and all suggestions, and feedback is welcome.
