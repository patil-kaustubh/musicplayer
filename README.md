# musicplayer
Case study of a music player using core java concepts. For this project, I used Eclipse IDE. Created project, packages, classes and interface as per requirement. Used core java concepts like Inheritance, Decision making statements, Looping statements, Scanner, Object creation, etc. Please have a look at my project and all suggestions, and feedback is welcome.
This is a Java program that implements a basic music player with different menus for playing, adding/removing, and updating songs. The program consists of six classes and an interface:

Menu: an interface that defines three methods: printMenu() for displaying the menu, getUserInput() for getting user input, and executeUserAction(int userChoice) for executing the user's chosen action.
Utility: a utility class that contains a Scanner object and a method for getting user input from the Scanner.
MainMenu: a class that implements the Menu interface and defines the main menu of the program. It has a boolean variable subMenuLoop that is set to true when a sub-menu is entered, and a switch statement in the executeUserAction() method that creates instances of sub-menus depending on the user's choice and enters a loop to display the sub-menu until the user chooses to go back.
AddRemoveSongMenu, UpdateSongMenu, and PlaySongMenu: classes that implement the Menu interface and define the sub-menus for adding/removing, updating, and playing songs, respectively. Each sub-menu has its own switch statement in the executeUserAction() method that performs different actions depending on the user's choice.
The program starts by creating an instance of the MainMenu class and entering a loop that displays the main menu and waits for user input. When the user chooses a menu option, the executeUserAction() method of the MainMenu class creates an instance of the corresponding sub-menu class and enters a loop to display the sub-menu and wait for user input until the user chooses to go back. When the user goes back from a sub-menu, the loop in the MainMenu class resumes and displays the main menu again.

Overall, this program demonstrates the use of interfaces, classes, objects, and control structures in Java programming, as well as the use of a Scanner object for getting user input from the console.
